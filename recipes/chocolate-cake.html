        <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Frosting:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>5 1/3 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups unsweetened cocoa powder</li>            
        <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and
            flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>Make cake: Stir together sugar, flour, cocoa, baking soda,
            baking powder, and salt in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla; mix for 3 minutes with an
            electric mixer. Stir in boiling water by hand.</li>
        <li>Pour evenly into the prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into
            the centers comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10
            minutes before removing from pans to cool completely.</li>
        <li>While cakes cool, make frosting: Cream butter with an
            electric mixer until light and fluffy. Stir in confectioners'
            sugar and cocoa alternately with milk and vanilla. Beat to a
            smooth spreading consistency.</li>
        <li>Split the layers of the cooled cake horizontally, cover the
            top of each layer with frosting, then stack them onto a
            serving plate.</li>
        <li>Frost the outside of the cake with remaining frosting.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
